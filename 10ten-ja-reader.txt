After some digging, I finally came up a howto. Without any redundancy, let's go.

1   preparing the environment for compiling the code.

I personally use Manjaro, this step is simply done by issuing one command: sudo pacman -S yarn.

2   download the release code from github: https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader

It's a tarball. unpack it to anywhere you want to put them.

3   editing the source files.

I just touched on 2 files located at 10ten-ja-reader-1.4.7/css/popup.css and 10ten-ja-reader-1.4.7/css/themes.css relatively.
as to the former, I changed the lines started with "font-size" and ending with "px" suffixes. It looks like this:

.w-kanji {
  font-size: 21px;
  margin-right: 0.7em;
  color: var(--primary-highlight);
}

.w-kanji .w-unmatched,
.w-kanji .w-separator {
  opacity: 0.6;
}

.w-kana {
  font-size: 21px;
  margin-right: 0.3em;
}
as to the latter:

  --primary-highlight: #DA70D6;

.window.theme-lightblue .w-kanji {
    color: #DA70D6;
}

.window.theme-lightblue .w-kana {
    color: #1E90FF;
}

4   compiling the code

Issuing the command: yarn package:chrome is enough. if everything goes well, you get a directory with a zip file in it located at 10ten-ja-reader-1.4.7/dist-chrome-package/ relatively.

5  test it in the browser.

For Chrome browser, just type in this: chrome://extensions/ and toggle on the developer mode.

Unpacking the zip file we got to a directory and copy its path and paste it into the edit box which you can see by clicking the "Pack extension" button on the page just opened.

After some busy CPU cycles to download the dictionaries which the 10ten-ja-reader automatically does, you should see the change.
